# x-material
We aim to create a toolkit of web components that does not require huge frameworks, custom JavaScript processors and does not dictate the user how their apps should be developed. Instead the x-material provides pluggable and friendly custom components that do not differ conceptually from other HTML elements. 

The library is built on top of x-tag and provides lightweight web components for designing user interfaces according to Material Design specification. The library is very much work in progress and will likely to change public API frequently - it currently cannot be used in production.
